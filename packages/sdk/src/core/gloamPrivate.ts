/**
 * GloamPrivate: Cloak's private account on Gloam, with the same methods and return shapes the site's pages already call
 * on CloakPrivate, so the site keeps its pages and only its backend changes (one setting, `core: "gloam"`).
 *
 * Underneath are two GloamCores made from the same one wallet signature, so one private address (gloamr1.) receives in
 * both vaults:
 *   - Gloam's vault, the big shared crowd (HYPE, USDC and what Gloam lists);
 *   - Cloak's launch vault (CloakLaunchVault, Gloam's code and keys), where launch tokens trade from the moment their
 *     launch settles.
 * Balances add up across both. A deposit goes to the launch vault when it takes the asset (so it can trade), else to
 * Gloam's. A send or a cash out draws from Gloam's vault first, then the launch vault.
 *
 * Pages pass a market's `pool` to the money methods. Here a market's pool is its asset (address 0 for HYPE): there is
 * no pool per token, so the pool id just names what to spend.
 *
 * What Gloam's design changes for the pages (shown by the same UI, with different numbers):
 *   - relayFee() is 0: Cloak's relay pays gas (from the launch vault's fee and its own budget);
 *   - afterFee() takes the vault's cash-out fee (0.5% on Elysium);
 *   - a payment received is "pending" until the next sync sweeps it into this account's own note.
