/**
 * @title GloakToken
 * @notice Cloak's one private-only token experiment (docs/GLOAK-EXPERIMENT.md). It is meant to live in private vaults
 *         and be traded only through private routers. Bringing it in and trading it privately are free; taking it out
 *         to a public address, or moving it between public addresses, burns a surcharge (10%, never raised).
 *
 *         The token keeps a list of approved contracts, each with roles:
 *          - RECEIVE  receives for free (vaults, routers, batch rounds, the hook);
 *          - SEND     sends to anyone for free (the launch's auction, which pays bidders; the hook);
 *          - FEED     may send into Uniswap's PoolManager (the hook, routers, batch rounds). Nobody else can, so nobody
 *                     outside the private zone can sell into a pool, add liquidity, or turn tokens into v4 claims;
 *          - SWAP     may swap in GLOAK's own pool (the hook asks canSwap): routers that always deliver into a vault;
 *          - VAULT    a private vault. Its withdrawals pay the surcharge, unless the recipient is a one-time swap
 *                     escrow that hands everything to a PAYEE in the same transaction (a private sell): then the
 *                     surcharge goes on to the PAYEE, so the swap gets the full amount;
 *          - PAYEE    a router or batch round that one-time escrows pay (it receives that refund).
 *
 *         The admin (Cloak's owner wallet) sets roles at once during setup. After endSetup, adding a role waits 3 days
 *         in public; removing one is instant. The surcharge can only be lowered. What the admin may grant is limited,
 *         in setup too: SEND never (only the launch's auction and the hook have it, from the constructor), and FEED or
 *         SWAP only to an address with code, since those open Uniswap. RECEIVE, VAULT and PAYEE may go to any address:
 *         they make arriving free, never leaving, so what an approved address sends on to a public one still pays.
 *
 *         Supply is fixed at launch and only ever falls: nothing is minted after the constructor. A vault withdrawal's
 *         surcharge isn't burned on the spot but held by the token itself (balanceOf[address(this)]) for the rest of
 *         that transaction, because a one-time escrow can't be recognised in advance. If the escrow hands its whole
 *         balance to a PAYEE in the same transaction, the held surcharge moves on to the PAYEE as a plain transfer.
 *         Whatever is held after its transaction is burned by the next transfer of GLOAK, or by anyone at once with
 *         burnHeld(). Every other surcharge burns at once.
 *
 * @dev What a withdrawal's surcharge may still owe is remembered in transient storage (EIP-1153), keyed by the
 *      recipient, plus a running total, so a burn inside that transaction can never take what is still owed.
