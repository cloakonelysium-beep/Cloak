/**
 * @title CloakLaunchSwapV4
 * @notice The Uniswap v4 venue for CloakLaunchSwapBase: private swaps on Cloak's launch vault through v4 pools, the
 *         price buffer back to the trader (the base owes it to the swap). Cloak's launches open on v4 pools, so this is
 *         how a launch token trades privately the moment it settles.
 *
 * The swap logic is Gloam's GloamVaultSwapV4c's (route walk, exact-out from the last hop, middle currencies netting
 * to zero, native and wrapped HYPE both, paying by sync/transfer/settle with no approval), with one difference: no
 * allowlist with a 3-day wait. Instead a pool is usable at once if its hook is none or Cloak's own reviewed hook
 * (CloakV4Hook, immutable here). The one exception: the door's private-only token (GLOAK) is usable only in Cloak's
 * hooked pool, never in a pool with no hook, where its swaps would skip the token's pool gate and Uniswap's claims
 * could carry it around in public. So a hostile hook can't be on any route, and what a pool priced against the swap can
 * take is bounded as in V4c: the new note is exactly d.amount (its proof binds it, the base checks it arrived), the
 * swap pays at most what the note brought in, and every route is fixed in the swap's escrow key.
 *
 * route = abi.encode(PoolKey[]), pools in order from the input to the output, at most 3.

 * @title CloakRouterV4

 *         ecosystem tokens (KNTQ, ...) in Cloak's ecosystem vault, and HYPE, USDC and everything else in Gloam's vault.
 *         A buy spends a HYPE note in Gloam's vault and deposits the token as a note in its vault; a sell does the
 *         reverse. Same calls, escrows, refunds and exits as CloakLaunchSwapV4.
 *
 *         Which vault an asset uses is decided here, not by the caller: a token the launch vault admitted
 *         (isLaunchToken) uses the launch vault, one the ecosystem vault admitted (isEcosystemToken) the ecosystem
 *         vault, anything else Gloam's vault. Neither flag is ever cleared, and the vaults are fixed at deploy with no
 *         owner, so nobody can point a swap at another vault. A vault only pays out a note with its owner's proof, to the
 *         escrow that proof names, so a bug here can cost at most a swap in flight, never what the vaults hold.
 *
 *         Cloak's fee. A sale out of Cloak's vaults (a launch or ecosystem token) into Gloam's vault (HYPE, USDC) pays
 *         CloakTradeFee's rate on what it brings, in that asset, to Cloak's treasury: the router buys the trader's exact
