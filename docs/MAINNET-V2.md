# Cloak v2 on Gloam: mainnet roadmap and to-do list

Status on Nov 8 (night). Tick items as they land. Each says who it waits on: **Bob**, **Gloam**, **Kinetiq** (Elysium), or **Claude** (can be built now).

## Where v2 stands

Built, tested and pushed to `main`. All of it runs on Gloam's vault, circuits and final keys:
- **Launch vault and escrows:** the launch vault, private v4 swaps, v4 batch rounds (time-weighted price, 4% side cap), sealed bids from a private balance, graduation, receive addresses, allocation gates and receipts.
- **Keeper:** our relay (Gloam's rules, paid from the launch vault's fee) and the keeper loop (admit launches, register markets, settle rounds, confirm gates). It also publishes sealed bids that can't be opened.
- **Site:** every page runs on the Gloam backend, including withdrawals in pieces over time, payment links and requests, and the docs page.
- **SDK and agent tools:** the SDK, and the MCP agent tools including payment links.
- **Tests:** 122 forge tests, 65 v4 forge tests, 17 end-to-end runs, and the real site in a browser on a testnet fork. CI runs v2 only.
- **Outside reviews:** two, with every finding fixed or decided (`docs/REVIEW-RESPONSES.md`).
- **Mainnet deploy script ready:** `e2e-gloam/deploy-partner.mjs` deploys next to Gloam's own vault and hands control to a Safe. Rehearsed on a testnet fork (0.022 HYPE). The config template is `deployments/elysium-mainnet-gloam.input.example.json`.

## The vault model (decided Nov 9)

- **Gloam's vault** holds HYPE and USDC (maybe KNTQ later). Cloak doesn't hold the ecosystem's major assets.
- **Cloak's launch vault** (Gloam's audited vault engine and final keys, plus `admitLaunch`, run by our Safe) holds Cloak launch tokens.
- **One home per asset.** No graduation: `CloakGraduation` isn't deployed on mainnet (`deploy-partner.mjs` deploys it only with `"graduation": true`).
- **CloakRouterV4** joins the two, as v1's router did: a buy spends HYPE in Gloam's vault and lands the token in the launch vault, in one relayed call; a sell does the reverse. The router decides each asset's vault (a launch token: the launch vault, anything else: Gloam's), so nobody can point a swap elsewhere. It's CloakLaunchSwapV4 plus one rule (about 40 lines). Tested in forge and with real proofs in `part19-v2-factory.mjs`.
- [x] **Batch rounds and private bids** follow the same rule (Nov 10): `CloakGloamBatcherV4` and `CloakGloamBids` take a HYPE vault at deploy (Gloam's on mainnet, `deploy-partner.mjs`). Buy orders and bids spend HYPE there; HYPE payouts and refunds go back there; tokens use the launch vault. Built with no HYPE vault (address 0), they keep HYPE in the launch vault as on testnet. Tested in forge and with real proofs (`part13-bids.mjs` runs in mainnet's model, `part19-v2-factory.mjs` has a batch round with HYPE in Gloam's vault).
- **Mainnet assumes Gloam's vault lists HYPE at public launch.** The launch vault gets no HYPE caps (no `"hype"` in the deploy config). If Gloam's HYPE listing slips, put `"hype"` caps back in the config, deploy the batcher and bids with address 0 as the HYPE vault, and leave `router` out of the deployment record: everything then runs as on testnet.
- **The ecosystem vault** (`CloakEcosystemVault`, Nov 10) holds outside tokens: KNTQ first, then other launchpads' tokens and stocks. Gloam's vault engine and keys, run by our owner wallet, with one way in: Cloak vets a launchpad's code once, then the owner wallet lists that launchpad's tokens at once (or a token vetted on its own, like KNTQ) if the preset rules hold (below). The router knows all three vaults (launch tokens, ecosystem tokens, everything else in Gloam's). Tested in forge (16 tests) and with real proofs (`part20-ecosystem.mjs`).
  - **Admission rules, fixed at deploy** (values in the mainnet config, `ecosystem`): only the owner wallet lists, from an approved launchpad or a token vetted on its own; a plain native-HYPE Uniswap v4 pool with no hook (one the router can trade); at least 250 HYPE in range; a market cap of at least 50,000 HYPE at the pool price; caps of at most 0.1% of supply per deposit and 1% in total. No delay (decided Nov 10). The pauser can pause listings or remove a launchpad; the owner can lower or zero a listed token's caps at once; withdrawals never close.
  - [x] **KNTQ on Elysium** (scan of mainnet, Nov 10): `0xe45a355d9e9cAd2aD85F2d03E3eE3102A036acF0` (Kinetiq's docs give the HyperEVM address, which has no code on Elysium). Its deepest native-HYPE v4 pool with no hook is 0.3% / 60 with about 30,200 HYPE in range, so it passes the rules and the router trades it today. Its market cap on Elysium (only the KNTQ bridged there, about 13.0M) is about 69,900 HYPE, so the market-cap preset is 50,000 HYPE, not 100,000.
  - [x] **HYPE/USDC needs nothing new:** a native-HYPE v4 pool with no hook, 0.3% / 60, holds about 27,300 HYPE and 2.0M USDC in range, so the router trades HYPE/USDC inside Gloam's vault with our own contracts (leftovers back to the user, no 3-day pool wait).
  - [x] **USDC as a market, and two-pool routes** (Nov 10). The router needed no change: a route is up to 3 pools, so USDC to a launch token or KNTQ is USDC to HYPE, then HYPE to the token, in one private swap (HYPE only passes through the PoolManager). The SDK has `trade(from, to, amount)` and `quoteTrade`; the Trade page has a "pay with" picker (HYPE or USDC); the MCP's `private_swap` takes `with`. USDC's pool comes from the deployment record (`assets[].pool`). Tested in forge (`CloakRouterV4Routes.t.sol`, 5 tests) and with real proofs (`part21-routes.mjs`: HYPE to USDC, USDC to KNTQ, KNTQ to USDC, USDC to HYPE). On testnet nothing changes until a router is in the deployment record.
  - [ ] **Bob:** the rule values (liquidity, market cap, caps). They're fixed once deployed.
  - [ ] **After deploy:** from the owner wallet, list KNTQ and approve any vetted launchpads (the deploy script prints the calls). Then set the keeper's `GLOAM_ECOSYSTEM_VAULT` and `GLOAM_ECOSYSTEM_VAULT_BLOCK`, and add `ecosystemVault` / `ecosystemVaultBlock` to the SDK's deployment record.
- **Fees:** a swap pays the withdrawal fee of the vault it spends from. Gloam's is 0.5% on Elysium (it was 0.25% until Nov 3, and their Base, Ethereum and Tempo deploys use 0.25%). With HYPE in Gloam's vault, every launch-token buy pays Gloam's fee, with no room for ours.
- [ ] **Bob with Gloam's founder:** the fee. A lower rate for cash outs into reviewed partner escrows (he's open to it, but their vault has no per-recipient rate, so it needs code before their Elysium vault is deployed), or a share of the 0.5% on the flows Cloak brings.
- [ ] **Bob:** our launch vault's rate (0.5% today, v1 charged 0.25%). Lowering it is instant.

- [x] **Money in from other chains and exchanges (Relay)**, Nov 10: deposit addresses and wallet bridging into the account's receive addresses on Elysium mainnet, from 20 chains. See `docs/BRIDGES.md`.
- [ ] **Spicenet:** their Elysium release (UI 4.23.2, core 0.10.1 and service activation), and a Privy app id from Bob. Then **Claude** adds the Spice Flow panel next to Relay's (`docs/BRIDGES.md`).
- [ ] **Bob:** a Relay API key if we want Solana deposits (and Relay's volume tagging).

## Stage 1: testnet complete (now)

- [x] **v2's own launch factory** on testnet (Nov 9): CloakConfig `0xfedf…4f1e`, factory `0x59d2…5784`, CloakV4Hook `0xC629…2A80`. The launch vault, batcher v4 (`0xbd4a…28f8`) and every escrow redeployed on it, the first launch GLOAK admitted and registered. `render.yaml` and `deployments.ts` point at them.
- [ ] **Gloam:** their testnet vault at `0x39E2…0194` (no code yet), with the guard, memo board, block and verifiers. Then **Claude** runs `deploy-partner.mjs` against it on testnet (that moves graduation, receive, the gate and the receipt check onto it, and the launch vault onto their verifiers), points `deployments.ts` at it, and reruns `part8-site.mjs` on a fork and the live script.
- [ ] **Gloam:** a Cloak partner account with `relayApproved`, and the reviews (packs in `docs/gloam-pack/`, brief `docs/FOR-GLOAM.md`).
- [ ] **Gloam:** the SDK release that knows 99801 and 99901, plus the change-note seed. Then **Claude** bumps it, uses the seed, and reruns all parts.

## Stage 2: hosting v2 (oncloak.xyz)

- [ ] **Bob:** before the repo goes public:
  - a secret scan of the history;
  - decide whether `GLOAM_QUESTIONS.md`, `docs/FOR-GLOAM.md` and the partnership parts of `REPORT.md` move somewhere private.
- [ ] **Bob:** a Vercel project on the same account, domain oncloak.xyz. The build needs nothing special, since the site defaults to Gloam. Set `VITE_KEEPER_URL` and `VITE_RELAYER_URL` to the v2 keeper.
- [ ] **Bob:** a v2 keeper on a new Render account (free plan, no custom domain yet): New > Blueprint on this repo. `render.yaml` holds the testnet addresses and settings. Set only `KEEPER_PK` in Render's dashboard, never in the repo. The env it sets:
  - `FACTORY` and `START_BLOCK` (v2's own launch factory) and `CORS_ORIGINS` (oncloak.xyz);
  - `GLOAM_VAULT`, `GLOAM_VAULT_BLOCK`, `GLOAM_LAUNCH_VAULT`, `GLOAM_LAUNCH_VAULT_BLOCK`, `GLOAM_MEMO`;
  - `GLOAM_ESCROWS` (launch swap v4, batcher v4, bids, receive, graduation, funds gate);
  - `GLOAM_BATCHER_V4`, `GLOAM_BATCHER_V4_BLOCK`, `GLOAM_FUNDS_GATE`;
  - `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=1`.

  The keeper stays awake on its own only while it has work (`docs/OPTIMIZATION.md` H1), so no outside ping is needed.
- [ ] **Bob:** the hosted checks in `CHECK.md` (hosting, free-plan behaviour, every feature timed, the open stress items).
- [ ] **Claude:** a run of the hosted site against the hosted keeper once both are up (shield, swap, batch, link, receive, withdraw in pieces).
- [ ] **Claude, after v2 is hosted (Bob's order):** the version dropdown on gloak (Testnet v1 goes to cloak, Testnet v2 stays, Private mainnet shows the access-code page with no codes and no backend), then the same on Cloak v1 as a patch for Bob.

## Stage 3: private mainnet (team only)

**From Gloam:**
- [ ] The mainnet vault, guard, memo board, block, verifiers and the USDC it lists. **Claude** fills in the deploy config from these.
- [ ] Answers to the open questions in `docs/FOR-GLOAM.md`: the fee share, the Safe on their guard, the relay from day one, our swap venue on their vault, and bridging.

**Done ahead (Nov 10):**
- [x] **Uniswap on Elysium:** Uniswap's deployment page lists v4 (PoolManager `0xE2e1…23F1`, the one we use), v3, v2 and Permit2 on Elysium. Our scan and configs already match.
- [x] **The whole mainnet deploy rehearsed on a fork of Elysium mainnet** (`e2e-gloam/part22-mainnet-fork.mjs`, 45 s, real proofs):
  - the launch factory from the mainnet factory config, with explicit values and nothing copied from v1, on Uniswap's official PoolManager; the owner wallet takes the config's ownership;
  - the real `deploy-partner.mjs` on the mainnet config, with Cloak's own fixed WHYPE (`CloakWHYPE`; Elysium's WHYPE is an upgradeable proxy);
  - USDC's real pool and real KNTQ checked against the rules, the owner taking both guards, and KNTQ listed;
  - private trades on real Uniswap pools: 1 HYPE to 69.77 USDC, and 100 USDC to 262.3 KNTQ through two pools.
  - About 0.045 HYPE for both deploys.
- [x] **The mainnet public RPC, measured:** no rate limit hit (120 parallel requests all answered), but **at most 10,000 logs per `eth_getLogs` answer**. Every log read now splits its range in halves when the answer would be too big (`logsSplitting`, head.ts), so a busy vault or memo board can't stall syncs.
- [x] **W-08:** the reveal window is capped at 7 days, in the contract (for the mainnet factory) and in the form.
- [x] **.ely names on mainnet** (Nov 12): the SDK has Elysium Name Service's mainnet contract (`0x41C5…7e3C`, from elysiumnameservice.xyz/developers.html, checked on chain: it answers `resolve` and is named "Ely Names"). Each network reads its own contract by chain id, so testnet and mainnet names never mix.
- [ ] **NFT drops on mainnet, with everything else** (every feature goes to private mainnet, no exception): `e2e-gloam/deploy-drops.mjs` with a mainnet input file (v2's mainnet `CloakConfig`, the mainnet metadata URL), then the three addresses into the SDK's mainnet entry. The same contracts as testnet's, which are Cloak v1's, redeployed on v2's config.
- [x] **The decisions left for Bob** are listed with recommendations in `docs/MAINNET-DECISIONS.md`: fees, caps, the pool-fee share and $CLOAK.

**From Kinetiq:**
- [ ] A public mainnet RPC that serves `eth_getLogs` at volume, the explorer and its verification API, and USDC's address.
- [ ] Who owns the v4 PoolManager (`0xe2e1…23f1`), and whether it moves to governance.
- [ ] Whether Elysium has EIP-2537 (BLS12-381), for provable sealed bids, and whether Timeboost is on.

**From Bob:**
- [ ] Cloak v2's own launch factory and hook on mainnet: `e2e-gloam/deploy-v2-factory.mjs` (done this way on testnet, Nov 9), then `deploy-partner.mjs` on it.
- [ ] **One owner wallet** (a software wallet in its own browser profile, seed phrase offline in two places) as guard controller, pauser and ecosystem approver, as Gloam runs theirs (one wallet, `GUARD_CONTROLLER_EOA=1` in their Elysium runbook, a multisig planned). Decided Nov 10: no Safe while Cloak is one person; moving to a multisig later is `transferController` plus `acceptController`, nothing redeployed. Plus a separate treasury wallet (its own seed), a fresh deployer key used once, and a keeper/relayer key (docs/MAINNET-DECISIONS.md, part F).
- [ ] Mainnet caps for the launch vault: HYPE per deposit and total, and launch tokens.
- [ ] Whether Cloak takes an interface fee inside its escrows (Gloam's partner fee can't be paid privately yet).

**Claude, once those are in:**
- [ ] `deploy-partner.mjs --config deployments/elysium-mainnet-gloam.input.json` (it checks USDC's HYPE pool before deploying and writes `assets` with it), then:
  - verify every contract on the explorer;
  - `node scripts/sdk-entry.mjs deployments/elysium-mainnet-gloam.json deployments/elysium-mainnet-v2-factory.json <keeper url>` prints the SDK's mainnet entry (router, ecosystem vault, USDC and its pool included): paste it into `deployments.ts` and publish the SDK;
  - the site picks mainnet with `VITE_CHAIN_ID=99901` (chain, RPC and addresses all follow from it); the keeper needs the router in `GLOAM_ESCROWS` and the ecosystem vault in `GLOAM_ECOSYSTEM_VAULT`;
  - small live checks (shield, swap, a USDC route, batch, send, withdraw).
- [ ] Send Gloam the mainnet v4 pool list for their router, once the first mainnet launches settle.

## Stage 4: public mainnet

- [ ] **Outside review** of our escrows and `CloakLaunchVault` (Kann's audit covers only Gloam's vault). Gloam offered to add partner escrows as a separate scope. Keep low caps until it's done.
- [ ] **Bob:** the announcement ("Powered by Gloam" is approved). Gloam then lists Cloak as a live partner on Elysium.
- [ ] **Bob:** the reviewers' credit and thank-you on X (Haider Ali, Ghost), as promised.

## Optimization (Nov 9)

- [x] Free-hosting pass (`docs/OPTIMIZATION.md`):
  - private balances read only new blocks, with one sync per refresh;
  - reloads and new devices skip the vault history;
  - no keeper snapshot (removed with v1's keeper code);
  - the keeper sleeps when idle;
  - the hashing download is about 1 MB smaller;
  - hidden tabs don't poll.

  Tests: part 17, part 18, the stand-in Poseidon test, and part 8 in a browser.
- [ ] **Later:** a CDN in front of the keeper (G1), and keeper state that survives restarts (G2).

## Security and review follow-ups

- [x] Overnight stress test (Nov 8 to 9): contracts, off-chain and website. The fixes are live on testnet. Report: `docs/STRESS-REPORT.md`.
- [ ] **Bob:** the three decisions in `docs/STRESS-REPORT.md` (W-01 deposit cap, W-03 penalty floor, W-08 reveal window ceiling).
- [ ] **Keeper hosting:** set `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` (1 behind Render's proxy, 0 with nothing in front).

- [ ] **Bob:** apply `docs/patches/v1-min-reveal-window.patch` to Cloak v1 (it applies cleanly to v1's `main`). It's needed in v1's mainnet contracts too.
- [ ] **Bob:** apply `docs/patches/v1-batcher-band-and-deadline.patch` to Cloak v1 (the fix promised to Ghost: refuse instead of clamp, plus a settling deadline). It applies cleanly to v1's `main`.
- [ ] **Bob:** the launch no-reveal penalty floor (10% today, 25% on drops), and a notional floor per price tick (CL-02) in the next factory.
- [ ] **Claude, next factory:** seed the drop lottery from a drand round after the reveal deadline (removes the sequencer's last influence on CL-01).
- [ ] Haider's feedback files, if he sends them.

## Product work, after the above

- [ ] **Private bridging in** (`docs/ROUTES-AND-BRIDGE.md`): Relay first, then Spicenet (their docs from Bob), then Kinetiq's bridge.
  - Everything delivers to a fresh receive address.
  - Needs a Bridge panel, per-bridge tracking, and the keeper redeeming stuck tickets.
  - Bob: paste or push `PRIVATE-BRIDGE.md`, and fund a v2 key on HyperEVM testnet.
- [ ] **More swap pairs without an aggregator:** `CloakLaunchSwapV4` on Gloam's vault (USDC/HYPE and ecosystem tokens through hookless v4 pools), after Gloam says yes. Then a venue per non-v4 DEX a partner uses. Check mainnet's pools in its first week (KNTQ/HYPE, stock tokens).
- [ ] **Claude:** a smaller bundle (swap heavy Poseidon libraries for `poseidon-lite` where possible).
- [ ] **Claude:** escrows that post their payout's memo in the same transaction (waiting on Gloam's memo board taking posts before the note is in the vault).
- [x] Cloak's own private layer removed from v2 (Nov 9): v1's vaults, circuits, SDK classes, keeper loop and site code. Cloak v1 keeps it in its own repository.
