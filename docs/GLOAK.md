# GLOAK

A token that lives in private vaults. This page explains how it works, for privacy protocols on Elysium that may want to hold and trade it, and for anyone checking its rules. Contract addresses are published at deploy.

> **GLOAK is Cloak's token, not Gloam's.** It has no connection to Gloam's $GLOAM token. It's Cloak's inaugural launch: the first sealed-bid launch on Cloak.

## In one paragraph

GLOAK is an ERC-20 meant to be held and traded privately. Moving it into a private vault and trading it through private routers is free. Taking it out to a public address, or moving it between public addresses, burns 10% of what is sent. Its only Uniswap pool accepts swaps from approved private routers alone, so it can't be bought or sold in public. Any privacy protocol on Elysium can hold and trade it once its vault and router are approved.

## The token

| | |
|---|---|
| Standard | ERC-20, 18 decimals |
| Supply at launch | 500,000 GLOAK, minted once, all to the launch auction |
| Team share | None |
| Minting | None after launch, ever: supply only falls (since Nov 12, see "Why private sells are free" below) |
| Upgrades | None. No proxy |
| Surcharge | 10%, burned. It can be lowered, never raised |
| Admin | Cloak's owner wallet, with limited powers (see "Who controls what") |

## The rule

Every address has a set of roles, empty by default. A transfer is checked in this order:

1. **Into Uniswap's PoolManager:** allowed only from an address with **Feed**. Otherwise it reverts.
2. **To an address with Receive, or to 0x…dEaD:** free.
3. **From an address with Send:** free.
4. **Anything else:** 10% of the amount is burned and the rest arrives.

| Move | Cost |
|---|---|
| Deposit into an approved vault | Free; the vault receives the exact amount |
| Private buy or sell through an approved router | Free |
| Withdraw from a vault to a public address | 10% burned |
| Public address to public address | 10% burned |
| Public address paying into Uniswap (selling, adding liquidity, minting v4 claims) | Refused |
| Swapping in GLOAK's pool without the Swap role | Refused |
| Sending to 0x…dEaD | Free |
| Holding in a public address | Free |

### Roles

| Role | Bit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Receive | 1 | Transfers to this address are free |
| Send | 2 | Transfers from this address are free. Only the launch auction and Cloak's hook have it, from the start; nobody can grant it |
| Feed | 4 | May transfer GLOAK into Uniswap's PoolManager. Contracts only |
| Swap | 8 | May swap in GLOAK's pool (Cloak's hook asks `canSwap`). Contracts only |
| Vault | 16 | A private vault: its withdrawals are charged, and the charge is held until the recipient's first move (below) |
| Payee | 32 | A router that one-time escrows pay; it receives the held surcharge |

### Why private sells are free (and nothing is ever minted)

Private routers on Elysium usually spend a note by withdrawing it to a one-time escrow address, which then hands everything to the router. GLOAK can't recognise the escrow in advance: its address is new for every swap and has no code yet when the vault pays it. So the vault's payment to it is charged 10% like any withdrawal.

That 10% isn't burned on the spot. The token holds it in its own balance and records it as **owed** to the withdrawal's recipient (`owed(recipient)`). The recipient's first outgoing transfer settles it:
- **It sends its whole balance to a Payee** (the escrow handing off to the router): the token moves the held 10% on to the Payee as an ordinary transfer, and the swap has the full amount.
- **It sends GLOAK anywhere else** (a real withdrawal's owner moving their GLOAK): the held 10% burns.
- **It never moves:** after 14 days anyone can call `releaseOwed(recipient)`, and the held 10% burns.

What's owed is kept in storage, so the hand-off doesn't have to happen in the withdrawal's own transaction. If someone copies a pending sell's proof and sends the withdrawal alone (front-running it), the 10% stays owed to the escrow, and the sell still gets the full amount, whether it then goes through or is rescued after its deadline. A zero-value transfer never settles anything, since it needs no allowance. Only surcharges owed to nobody can be burned (`heldForBurn()`, `burnHeld()`).

Until Nov 13 this record lived only for the withdrawal's transaction (transient storage), so a withdrawal sent alone lost its 10%. The Nov 13 audit flagged it, and it was changed before GLOAK's launch.

Other surcharges (sends between public addresses, a public exit from the router) burn at once.

Nothing is minted after the constructor, so supply only falls. Until Nov 12 the token minted the 10% back to the router instead (a same-transaction refund that never raised supply, but showed as a mint). It was changed before GLOAK's launch, so no deployed GLOAK ever had it.

## The launch

GLOAK launches on Cloak, in a sealed-bid auction: bids are hidden until a reveal window, and every winner pays one clearing price. With prices in HYPE per GLOAK:

- **Clearing price** `p`: the highest price at which revealed demand covers the sale; if demand never covers it, everyone fills at the lowest revealed price.
- **Sold:** the sale supply if covered, otherwise total demand.
- **Raised** = `p × sold`, less a tiny rounding buffer.
- **Launch fee** = 1.5% of raised, to Cloak.
- **Net** = raised − fee.
- **Pool HYPE** = net × the pool share chosen at launch: at least 50%, Cloak's floor for every launch; GLOAK uses 70%.
- **Pool GLOAK** = pool HYPE ÷ `p`. The pool reserve must be at least the sale × the pool share, so the pool always gets its full share.
- The pool opens at exactly `p`, as one full-range position. **It is locked forever**: nobody can add or remove liquidity.
- **Creator proceeds** = net − pool HYPE. The creator is Cloak.
- **Unused GLOAK** is sent to 0x…dEaD: the unsold sale supply plus the unused pool reserve. It stays in the total supply but can never move.
- **No minimum raise.** GLOAK opens its pool whatever it raises.

Worked example: 300,000 for sale, 200,000 for the pool, a 50% pool share, and 3 HYPE of bids at 0.00001 HYPE.
- All 300,000 are sold and 2.9999 HYPE is raised; the fee is 0.045 HYPE.
- The pool opens with 1.4775 HYPE and 147,750 GLOAK; Cloak's proceeds are 1.4775 HYPE.
- 52,250 GLOAK of unused pool reserve goes to 0x…dEaD.

GLOAK's own parameters are 294,000 for sale and 206,000 for the pool, with 70% of the raise into the pool, at 0.0002 to 0.01 HYPE per GLOAK. Sold out at the lowest price, that raises 58.8 HYPE and opens a pool of about 40.5 HYPE.

**Claims.** The auction pays every winner free of the surcharge. A private bidder's winnings go straight into the vault as a note. A public bidder receives GLOAK in their wallet and can deposit it into a vault for free. From then on the rule applies.

**Anti-snipe fee.** The pool's swap fee starts high when it opens and falls to its base rate over the first minutes.

## The pool

- A native HYPE / GLOAK pool on Uniswap v4, behind Cloak's hook. The pool key is: currency0 native HYPE (address 0), currency1 GLOAK, a dynamic fee, tick spacing 60, and Cloak's hook.
- **Private-only.** Before every swap in this pool, the hook asks GLOAK `canSwap(sender)`. Only Swap-role routers pass. Uniswap's Universal Router, aggregators and bots are refused.
- **Public price.** The pool's price and each trade's size are public, as for any Uniswap pool. Who trades, and who holds GLOAK, are not.
- **Fees:** 80% to the creator and 20% to Cloak; both are Cloak here. The HYPE part funds GLOAK buybacks, which are burned at 0x…dEaD. Fees paid in GLOAK pay the 10% on their way out.
- This is the only private pool Cloak's hook will ever have. Every other Cloak launch pool is unaffected.

## The privacy meter

`meter()` returns where GLOAK is right now:
- in approved vaults;
- in Uniswap's PoolManager (the pool);
- in other approved contracts;
- at 0x…dEaD;
- in public addresses (everything else);
- the vaults' share of everything not at 0x…dEaD, in basis points.

## For privacy protocols: holding and trading GLOAK

Your protocol needs two approvals:

**Your vault: Receive, Vault.**
- Deposits arrive in full, so exact-amount checks pass.
- Withdrawals to public addresses pay 10%.

**Your router: Receive, Feed, Swap, Payee.** We approve a router only if:
- **It always delivers swap output into a vault.** Never to a public address, never as Uniswap v4 claims (ERC-6909). Swap opens GLOAK's pool to it, so this keeps the pool private.
- **It never lets a user pay GLOAK into Uniswap outside a swap** (adding liquidity, settling for claims).
- **It supports hooked, dynamic-fee v4 pools.**
- **For free private sells, it withdraws through a one-time escrow that hands its whole balance to the router.** Any other design works, but its sells pay 10%.
- **Leftovers paid out to a public address pay 10%**, like any exit.

**Treat GLOAK as fee-on-transfer outside your vault and router.** A transfer to an address without Receive delivers 90% of the amount.

**The process:**
1. We review your vault and router.
2. Cloak's owner wallet queues the roles on GLOAK. The change is public on-chain for 3 days.
3. It is applied, and we announce it together.

Approval can be removed at once if a contract is found unsafe. Deposits into a vault that lost its approval stop, and its withdrawals and sells then pay 10%. Nobody can move the funds in it.

### Integration note: what changes on your side

Usually nothing. GLOAK doesn't ask a protocol to work a particular way: Cloak approves your contracts, and the token reacts to their roles. Your contracts and mechanics stay as they are.

| What your protocol does | What GLOAK needs from us | Code change on your side |
|---|---|---|
| Users deposit (shield) GLOAK into your pool | Your vault gets Receive and Vault | None |
| Private transfers inside your pool | Nothing: no tokens move | None |
| A withdrawal to a wallet | Nothing: it pays 10%, as intended | None |
| A private swap through a one-time escrow that hands everything to your router (Gloam's design), in the same transaction or a later one | Your router gets Payee (plus Receive, Feed, Swap) | None: the token handles any escrow, whatever its address |
| A private swap where your vault pays your router directly | Your router gets Receive (plus Feed, Swap) | None |
| A private swap whose escrow moves only part of its balance first | Nothing helps | That sell pays 10% unless the flow changes |

Two things may need a setting, not new code:
- **Your router must trade on Uniswap v4 directly, in GLOAK's own pool.** Uniswap's Universal Router and aggregators are refused on purpose: that's what keeps GLOAK out of public trading.
- **If your router keeps a list of allowed v4 hooks or pools**, it must allow Cloak's hook, since GLOAK's only pool uses it.
- **Your router should never route GLOAK through a pool with no hook.** Anyone can open one, and Uniswap's claims (ERC-6909) would then carry GLOAK around in public without the surcharge. Cloak's router refuses it; a router that only uses pools it lists (Gloam's) is fine as long as no such pool is listed.

What it costs: every approval after GLOAK's setup waits 3 days in public, and the swap and Uniswap roles (Swap, Feed) go only to contracts.

**Gloam, for example.** Cloak approves Gloam's vault (Receive, Vault) and Gloam's v4 swap router (Receive, Feed, Swap, Payee). Gloam lists GLOAK in its vault (a deposit limit, through its own 3-day timelock) and allows GLOAK's pool in its router, from the router's deploy or through its 3-day pool queue. No change to Gloam's contracts.

Tested Nov 12 on a fork of Elysium mainnet (`contracts-v4/test/GloakOnGloam.t.sol`): Gloam's real vault at its real address, with its owner guard, limits and 0.5% cash-out fee, and Gloam's own `GloamVaultSwapV4c`, unmodified (Gloam has no swap router on Elysium yet, so the test deploys their code as they would). Proof checks are stubbed there; real proofs on the same vault are part 22's.
- Shielding GLOAK into Gloam's vault is free and exact, and the meter counts it as private.
- A withdrawal to a wallet pays Gloam's fee, then GLOAK's 10%, which burns.
- A private sell from Gloam's vault through Gloam's router and escrow is free: the escrow's 10% is held and handed on to Gloam's router, nothing is minted, and the exact HYPE lands as a new note in Gloam's vault.
- One thing for Gloam to know: their router sends a swap's leftover input (its price buffer) to Gloam's treasury, a public address, so that leftover pays 10% like any exit. A tighter buffer on GLOAK sells keeps it small.

## Moving GLOAK between vaults

A note can't move between vaults; each vault has its own tree. Moving is a withdrawal from one and a deposit into the other, and the withdrawal is what pays 10%.
- **Through an approved receiving address:** withdrawing to it is free and its deposit is free. What it sends anywhere else still pays 10%. Whoever controls it holds the GLOAK between the two steps.
- **Through a migrator contract** (one transaction, through a one-time escrow, with Receive and Payee): free and trustless. Not built yet.
- **Through one's own wallet:** costs 10%.

Only a note's owner can move it. Neither Cloak nor any vault owner can move anyone's GLOAK.

## Who controls what

**Cloak's owner wallet (GLOAK's admin) can:**
- **Add roles.** Instant until it ends setup, which it does once the pool is open and the pool's batch-round adapter is approved; after that, each addition waits 3 days in public. A queued addition must be applied within 14 days after that, or it expires; and if the account's code changed since it was queued, it can't be applied.
- **Remove roles at once.**
- **Lower the surcharge.**
- **Hand the admin to another address**, in two steps.
- **Renounce the admin for good,** which freezes the roles and the surcharge.

**It can't:**
- mint, move, freeze or confiscate anyone's GLOAK;
- raise the surcharge;
- grant Send to anyone;
- grant Feed or Swap to a wallet, including one delegating to code (EIP-7702);
- give the token's own address a role.

**At launch, GLOAK is born with Cloak's private zone approved:** Cloak's launch vault (Receive, Vault), Cloak's router (Receive, Feed, Swap, Payee), Cloak's batch rounds (Receive, Feed, Swap, Payee) and Cloak's private bids (Receive). The pool's batch-round adapter gets Swap after the launch settles, and serves only callers GLOAK itself lets swap, so it never opens the pool to the public. The auction and the hook have Receive and Send, and the hook also has Feed.

**Cloak's contracts changed only once for GLOAK:**
- **The launch-token deployer has a one-time door.** The owner wallet used it once, to launch GLOAK with this token, and it can never be used again. It only accepts a factory and a maker built for it.
- **A failed GLOAK launch burns its supply.** If no bid at all is revealed (or a minimum raise isn't met), an ordinary launch returns its tokens to its creator. For the door's token they go to 0x…dEaD instead, so they can never reach a public wallet without the surcharge. GLOAK's reveal window is 6 hours, and anyone can reveal a bid.
- **Cloak's hook records the door's token's pool as its single private pool**, set at that pool's opening and never changeable. For every other pool, the hook behaves exactly as before.

## Known limits

- **One owner key.** The admin is Cloak's owner wallet, a single key, until Elysium supports a multisig (on the roadmap). It ends setup as soon as GLOAK's pool and adapter are approved, after which every new role waits 3 days in public.
- **A withdrawal's 10% can sit held for a while.** It burns at the recipient's first move, or after 14 days via `releaseOwed`. Until then it's out of circulation (the meter and the page count it as burned), but `totalSupply()` still includes it.
- **Public bids are possible.** A public winner gets public GLOAK, free at the claim.
- **A thin pool moves a lot.** The pool's depth is fixed at launch: with about 1.5 HYPE in it, a 0.2 HYPE buy moves the price by roughly a quarter.
- **Exchanges and public DEXs can't really hold it.** Every move to a public address pays 10%.
