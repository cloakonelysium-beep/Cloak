          <h2>What is Cloak?</h2>
          <p>On Elysium, one sequencer orders transactions first come, first served, several blocks a second. A normal token launch becomes a race that the fastest bots win in the first block. After that, every buy, sell and balance is public forever and tied to your wallet.</p>
          <p>Cloak fixes both. <b>Launches</b> are sealed-bid auctions: nobody sees a bid until bidding closes, and every winner pays one clearing price. <b>After launch</b>, you can hold, trade and send the token from a private balance. Proofs are made on your device and a relayer submits for you, so your wallet never appears.</p>
          <p><b>In partnership with <a href="https://gloam.trade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gloam</a>.</b> Private balances, payments and their proofs run on Gloam's privacy layer: Gloam's vault, its memo board and its final ceremony keys. Cloak's launches, its launch vault, its ecosystem vault and its escrows are Cloak's own, run by Cloak.</p>

          <div className="crumb" style={{ marginTop: 60 }}>Launches</div>
          <h2 id="sealed-launches">Sealed launches</h2>
          <p>A launch is a silent auction with three phases:</p>
          <table>
            <thead><tr><th>Phase</th><th>What happens</th><th>What the chain sees</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td>Sealed bidding</td><td>You choose a max price and quantity. Your deposit is rounded up to a standard bucket (1, 2, 5 × 10ⁿ) so it doesn't reveal your bid.</td><td>A hash and a timelock ciphertext</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Auto-reveal</td><td>When bidding ends, the <a href="https://drand.love" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">drand</a> beacon releases the key. Any keeper (or you) decrypts and reveals every bid.</td><td>The bids, now readable</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Settle</td><td>One clearing price is computed, and the pool is seeded at that price.</td><td>The demand curve and the clearing price</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p><b>Bid from your private balance.</b> On the bid card, pick "Private balance". Your private HYPE pays a fresh one-time wallet through the relayer, and that wallet places the bid, so nobody can tie the bid to your own wallet. After the launch, one click claims your tokens into your private balance and moves any refund back. The one-time wallets come from your private account, so the same wallet signature finds them again on any device.</p>
          <p>The contract only checks that a revealed bid matches its hash. A keeper can open a bid but never change it. Bids that aren't revealed get refunded minus a small burned penalty, so nobody can strategically withhold.</p>

          <h2 id="clearing-price">The clearing price</h2>
          <p>Bids are grouped by price level. Settlement walks from the highest level down until demand covers supply. That level is the <b>clearing price</b>, and every winner pays it, including people who bid higher. Bids at exactly that level share what's left pro rata. Bids below it get their whole deposit back.</p>
          <p>Because the price doesn't depend on order, bidding early, fast or with more gas earns nothing. That's the whole point on a fee-ordered chain.</p>

          <h2 id="liquidity">Locked liquidity</h2>
          <p>A share of the raise (default 50%) plus matching tokens opens the token's pool <b>at exactly the clearing price</b>, so trading opens at the fair price with no first-block arbitrage. The creator picks what happens to the LP: <b>locked forever, with the creator earning the trading fees</b> (the default), or burned. Cloak keeps 20% of the trading fee and the creator gets 80%. Unsold tokens, and any tokens the pool didn't need, are burned. Whatever HYPE the pool didn't need goes to the creator.</p>
          <p>A pool's address is known before it exists, so someone could try to send it tokens or WHYPE early and make the launch open at a silly price. Settlement handles every case:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anything sent to the pool's address before it has reserves is swept to the burn address.</li>
            <li>If someone synced reserves into it, the launch tops up the other side so the pool still opens at the clearing price. Whoever sent them just loses them.</li>
            <li>If someone already put their own liquidity in the pool (which needs launch tokens before settlement), that pool is ignored and the launch opens a Cloak pool instead, so nobody else's position sets the price.</li>
            <li>The Uniswap step always gets a fixed 6,000,000 gas, and settlement refuses to run with less, so nobody can force the fallback by sending too little gas.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Creator fees</h3>
          <p>Every trade on a launch's pool, public or private, pays the pool's fee: 0.3%, or more in the first 5 minutes after listing. With "locked forever", the creator earns <b>80%</b> of it and Cloak <b>20%</b>, paid out by the hook whenever anyone triggers it. The creator earns from trading but can never take the liquidity itself. With "burned", the creator's 80% goes to the burn address. Bidding pays the creator through the raise.</p>

          <h2 id="uniswap">Trading on Uniswap</h2>
          <p><b>Every launch opens a Uniswap v4 pool</b> (native HYPE / token) at the clearing price, through Cloak's hook (<code>CloakV4Hook</code>). The hook:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Keeps the liquidity forever.</b> It owns the pool's only position and never removes it, and nobody else can add or remove liquidity, so nobody can pull depth out from under traders.</li>
            <li><b>Pays the trading fees</b> (0.3% per trade): 80% to the creator, or to 0x…dEaD for a launch that burns its LP, and 20% to Cloak. Anyone can trigger a payout, and where it goes is fixed.</li>
            <li><b>Charges an anti-snipe fee.</b> The fee starts at 10% when the pool opens and falls in a straight line to 0.3% over 5 minutes, so racing the listing costs the racer, and what they pay is split the same way.</li>
            <li><b>Keeps a time-weighted price</b> for batch rounds, updated before every swap.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The pool lives in Uniswap's own PoolManager, so the token trades on the Universal Router, aggregators and wallets like any v4 token, and private trades use the same pool through <code>CloakV4Market</code>. On testnet Cloak deploys Uniswap's PoolManager itself, built from Uniswap's source byte for byte like the one on Elysium mainnet; on mainnet it uses Uniswap's own. v4 liquidity is a position, not a token, so a v4 launch's LP is either locked forever (fees to the creator) or burned, never locked until a date.</p>
          <h2 id="nft-drops">NFT drops</h2>
          <p>A drop sells an NFT collection the same way a launch sells a token: sealed, with one price for every winner. There is no race, so bots and gas wars gain nothing. <Link to="/app/drops" className="link">See the drops</Link> or <Link to="/app/drops/create" className="link">create one</Link>.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>GTD</b> (optional): wallets on the creator's guaranteed list mint their spots at the GTD price during the GTD window. Spots nobody used roll into the auction.</li>
            <li><b>Sealed auction</b>: everyone else bids what they'd pay, at the creator's price or more. Bids are sealed to a drand round, so nobody can read one before bidding closes.</li>
            <li><b>WL bid boost</b>: a WL bid ranks as its price × (1 + boost), and a WL winner pays the clearing price ÷ (1 + boost), never under the creator's price. The boost (0% to 30%) is public on the drop page.</li>
            <li><b>Settle</b>: the highest-ranked bids win until the supply runs out, and every public winner pays the same price, the lowest winning bid. Bids tied at that price share what's left by a lottery seeded by every opened bid's salt and the hash of the block after settling, so nobody knew it in advance and nobody can steer it by keeping some of their bids sealed.</li>
            <li><b>Open</b>: once the drand round is out, the keeper opens every bid and the drop settles as soon as they're all open, usually within a minute. The reveal window (30 minutes by default) only matters if the keeper is late: anyone can then open the bids or settle from the drop page. A bid still sealed when the window ends loses 25% of its deposit (10% on drops made before Nov 7). Every bid must cover at least one NFT at the floor, so spam costs real money.</li>
            <li><b>Claim</b>: the keeper delivers NFTs and refunds an hour after settling, and any bidder can take theirs sooner from the drop page. Winners can take their NFTs to a fresh wallet before then. Anything unsold is the creator's to mint.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>A creator who wants a fixed price sets it as the floor: when demand sits at the floor, everyone pays exactly that. Each drop is one ERC-721 contract with ERC-2981 royalties; with no metadata folder of its own, Cloak serves each token's name and the collection image.</p>

          <h2 id="existing-nfts">Auctions of existing NFTs</h2>
          <p>Holders of any Elysium collection can auction tokens they already own the same way, with no new collection: a treasury sale, rare pieces, or a batch of a collection's leftovers. <Link to="/app/drops/create?existing" className="link">Auction your NFTs</Link>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Escrow</b>: <b>CloakEscrowDropFactory</b> moves every listed token from the owner into the auction contract in the same transaction that creates it, and bidding can't open unless the contract holds every one. The drop page checks it on chain and shows the tokens with their own metadata and traits.</li>
            <li><b>Bidding</b>: the same sealed auction as a drop: bids are sealed to a drand round, an optional WL gets a boost, the highest bids win and every winner pays one price. Up to 500 tokens per auction.</li>
            <li><b>Which token goes to whom</b>: after settling, every winning bid gets its run of slots in bid order, and slot s is the token at (s + r) mod supply, where r comes from every bid's sealed salt. Nobody knew r before the bids opened, and the order bids are claimed in can't change who gets which token.</li>
            <li><b>A collection that misbehaves</b>: each token transfer has a gas limit and is checked on arrival. If a collection refuses or fakes a transfer, the winner gets its money back for that token and the owner can take the token back, so nobody's refund is ever stuck.</li>
            <li><b>Unsold</b>: whatever nobody bought (everything, if nobody bid) goes back to the owner. The collection's own royalties apply on resale; Cloak takes its usual fee on sales.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A Cloak auction can only vouch for what it holds, not for the collection itself: check the collection's address on the drop page before you bid.</p>

          <h2 id="wl-spots">WL spot sales</h2>
          <p>When a partner collection gives out whitelist spots, they can be sold the same way: a drop whose supply is the number of spots, marked as a spot sale in <b>CloakSpotBook</b>. One book serves every sale. <Link to="/app/drops/create?spots" className="link">Sell WL spots</Link>.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Bid</b>: the sealed auction, floor, WL boost, ties and refunds work exactly as in any drop.</li>
            <li><b>Name wallets</b>: once the bids open and settle, each winning bid names the Elysium wallet to whitelist, one per spot it won. It can be a different wallet from the one that bid, and it can be changed until the deadline the seller set (1 to 90 days after the bids open).</li>
            <li><b>Hand over the list</b>: the sale page shows the whitelist as it fills, with a CSV download, and anyone can read it from the book on chain. Winners also get a receipt NFT.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The book only takes wallets from the wallet that placed a winning bid, one wallet per spot, and a wallet can hold only one spot per sale, so the list can't be padded or faked. Only drops made by Cloak's drop factory can be sales. Naming a wallet is a public transaction from the bidding wallet, so the link between the two is visible on chain to anyone who looks; the partner's list itself shows only the whitelisted wallets.</p>

          <div className="crumb" style={{ marginTop: 60 }}>Privacy</div>

"They use" : "It uses"} Gloam's vault code unchanged, plus one addition that lets in a settled Cloak launch{G?.ecosystemVault ? " or a token Cloak lists" : ""}. Gloam's main vault is Gloam's.</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Unlock</b>. You sign one message and your keys are made from it on this device.</li>
                <li><b>Shield</b>. You deposit HYPE, USDC or a launch token. It's the only public step.</li>
                <li><b>Swap</b>. One note leaves the vault into a one-time escrow that trades through the launch's own Uniswap v4 pool and puts the output back as a new note for you. Whatever the swap didn't need comes back as a note too. The proof fixes every detail, so the relayer can't change them.</li>
              </ol>
            </></>

          <h2 id="batch-auctions">Batch auctions</h2>
          <p>An instant private trade hides <i>who</i> traded, but its size still shows on the public pool. Batch mode hides the size too:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your amount is split into <b>standard sizes</b> (1, 2, 5 × 10ⁿ), the same sizes everyone uses.</li>
            <li>Orders collect into a <b>round</b> (30 s on testnet).</li>
            <li>When it ends, buys and sells <b>cross at the pool's average price over the round</b> (no pool fee, no impact), and only the net trades on the pool.</li>
            <li>Everyone on one side of a round gets the <b>same price</b>, and outputs return as private notes.</li>
          </ul>
          <><p>The rules. Orders are standard sizes, and each side of a round holds at most <b>4%</b> of the pool, so a round always settles and anything bigger waits for the next one. A round crosses at the pool's <b>average price over at least a whole round</b>, which nobody can move in one transaction. It won't settle while the pool sits more than <b>2%</b> from that average, or if its net trade would lose more than <b>5%</b> to price impact. If it can't settle within <b>10 minutes</b> every order gets its own input back. Payouts move into your private balance the next time Cloak is open.</p></>

          <h2 id="private-send">Private send</h2>
          <p>Every account has a <code>cloak:</code> address (shown in Portfolio). Sending to it is a transfer inside the vault. The chain sees that a private transaction happened, but not who paid whom or how much.</p>

          <h2 id="payment-links">Payment links</h2>
          <p>Money and requests that travel as a link, for HYPE and USDC. Make them on <Link to="/app/links" className="link">Payment links</Link>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Send money as a link.</b> The link holds its own private account, funded by a private send from yours. Whoever opens it claims the money into their private balance, or straight to any wallet. The relayer submits the claim and takes its fee from the link, so the person claiming needs no gas and no Cloak account. You can cover that fee so they get the full amount. Until someone claims it, you can take it back.</li>
            <li><b>Lock it with a passcode.</b> The link alone then opens nothing. Send the code another way, or show a riddle on the claim page whose answer is the code: post it in public and the first person to solve it wins. A guessable answer can be guessed by anyone with the link, so use a phrase for real money.</li>
            <li><b>Split it into shares.</b> A red envelope: one link, several equal shares, and each person who opens it claims one, first come first served. Drop it in a group chat.</li>
            <li><b>Request a payment.</b> A link that asks to be paid, with an amount (or none, for a tip jar), a note and your name. It pays your cloak: address privately, or a 0x wallet from the payer's private balance. Show it as a QR code for in-person payments.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Everything sits after the # in the link, which browsers never send to a server, so the details stay between the people who share it. A claim link is like cash: anyone who has it can claim it. The links you make are kept encrypted in your browser, under Your links.</p>
          <h2 id="private-usdc">Private USDC</h2>
          <><p>USDC lives in Gloam's main vault, shared with everyone who uses Gloam, so it hides in the biggest crowd. Shield it on Portfolio (the first time asks for an approval), then send it privately to any <code>cloak:</code> address or withdraw it to a fresh address. Like every private vault it has caps for now, per deposit and in total. A bigger deposit goes in as several, one signature each. The caps go up as Cloak and Gloam grow.</p></>
          <p>Elysium's USDC is bridged from Circle's USDC on HyperEVM. Circle can freeze the USDC held by the bridge, and the bridge operator can upgrade the Elysium USDC contract. That applies to everyone holding USDC on Elysium, inside Cloak or not.</p>

          <p>GLOAK is an experiment: a token that only lives in private vaults. On a public chain privacy is usually opt-in, so the few private holders stand out. GLOAK's rules make private the cheap place to be and public the expensive one, so holding it privately is the normal case. Moving it into a private vault and trading it privately is free. Taking it out to a public address, or sending it between public addresses, burns <b>10%</b> of what's sent, and that rate can be lowered but never raised. Its only Uniswap pool trades through approved private routers, so it can't be bought or sold in public.</p>

              <tr><td>Private sells</td><td>A private sell passes through a one-time escrow the token can't recognise in advance, so the vault's payment to it is charged 10%. The token holds that 10% instead of burning it, and passes it on to the router in the same transaction, so the sell is free.

          <h2 id="agents">AI agents (MCP)</h2>
          <p>Cloak has an MCP server, so Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor and other AI apps can work with it directly. It comes in two parts, so an agent's keys never leave the machine it runs on.</p>
          <p><b>The easy way.</b> Tell your agent: <code>Read https://oncloak.xyz/agent.md and set me up to trade privately.</code> The page is written for the agent. It works out what it can do in your app, sets up its own wallet and the connection, and only asks you for what it can't do itself, like getting free testnet HYPE from the faucet. It never needs your own wallet's key.</p>
          <p><b>Connect by link (read and plan).</b> Paste <code>https://oncloak.xyz/mcp</code> into your AI app. Nothing to install and no key. The agent can list launches, read a launch (bids stay hidden until bidding closes), price a sealed bid or a private swap, see vault totals and plan a launch. It never signs, and it refuses any message that looks like it carries a private key.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Claude</b> (claude.ai or Desktop): Settings, Connectors, Add custom connector, then paste the link.</li>
            <li><b>ChatGPT</b>: turn on developer mode under Apps and connectors, then add a connector with the link and no authentication.</li>
            <li><b>Claude Code</b>: <code>claude mcp add --transport http cloak https://oncloak.xyz/mcp</code></li>
            <li><b>Cursor, VS Code and others</b>: add a remote server with <code>{`{ "mcpServers": { "cloak": { "url": "https://oncloak.xyz/mcp" } } }`}</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>The full agent (launch, bid, trade privately).</b> This part runs on your own machine with a wallet made just for the agent, signs there, and makes its proofs there, under spending limits per transaction and per day (1 and 10 HYPE by default) with a dry run on every action. By hand: <code>npx -y @cloakely/mcp setup</code> makes the agent's wallet and prints its address to fund from the faucet, then <code>claude mcp add cloak -- npx -y @cloakely/mcp</code> (or the same <code>npx -y @cloakely/mcp</code> command in any other app's MCP settings). Full setup is in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloakely/mcp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">package README</a>.</p>

              <p>No function in any of these lets anyone, including us, move your money. A note leaves a vault only with its owner's proof, and every escrow has a way out after a timeout.

              <p>While this is young, the private vaults cap deposits, both per deposit and in total. On Elysium mainnet, Gloam's vault starts at <b>12 HYPE per deposit and 600 HYPE in total</b>, and 500 USDC per deposit and 25,000 in total. That's small on purpose, and it rises as Cloak and Gloam grow together. The cap never limits what you can do. A bigger deposit goes in as several, a bigger trade goes in as several trades, and a bigger bid goes in as several sealed bids at the same price, all automatically. Only the vault's total can stop a deposit, and the app says so when it's full. Withdrawals are never capped.</p>

            <li><b>Nobody can move your money.</b> No function in any Cloak contract does it, for us or anyone else.</li>
            <li><b>Rules in the code</b> (the auction, the pool opening, batch guards, fee ceilings, vaults that are never replaced) can't be changed by anyone. A new version can only be added next to the old one, and the old one keeps working.</li>
            <li><b>Rules in <code>CloakConfig</code></b> (fees under their ceilings, caps, the verifier, which assets and factories are allowed): setup ends for good at deploy, on testnet (since the Nov 12 redeploy) and on mainnet. The owner is one wallet (a multisig once Cloak has more than one person). Tightening a rule is instant, and loosening one is queued on-chain, waits a public <b>3 days</b>, and lapses if it isn't carried out within 14 days after that. Anyone who disagrees has 3 days to leave.</li>
            <li><b>Keeper and app settings</b> (the claim window, relay fee, default slippage) are how our hosted services behave. Anyone can run their own.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="keeper">Keeper & relayer</h2>
          <><p>The keeper is a small Node service. It reveals bids once the drand round passes and settles launches. It admits each settled launch to the launch vault and settles batch rounds. It relays private transactions (<code>POST /gloam/relay</code>) with no fee to you, paying the gas itself, and keeps its last gas each hour for withdrawals and refunds. It can delay or refuse a transaction but can't change one, because the proof binds every field. It also publishes sealed bids the time-lock key couldn't open (<code>GET /unopenable</code>). Anyone can run one with <code>node services/keeper/index.mjs</code>.</p></>

          <h2 id="limits">Limits & threat model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Sealed bids stop <i>ordering</i> games, not many-wallet games. Uniform pricing removes most of the reason to split.</li>
            <li>drand is a threshold network. A threshold collusion could decrypt bids early.</li>
            <li>The relayer sees your IP and can delay you. Anyone can run their own.</li>
            <><>
                <li>Proofs use Gloam's final ceremony keys, and Kann audited Gloam's vault. Cloak's own escrows and launch vault are reviewed internally, and an outside review comes next, with deposit caps until it's done.</li>
                <li>A private payment is spendable by its sender until the recipient's app sweeps it, which happens every time Cloak is open. The pending balance shows it.</li>
                <li>While the beta caps are on, one well-funded bidder (about 10,000 HYPE across 100 wallets) can fill a launch's deposit cap at the creator's minimum price and lock others out. They pay at least that minimum for every token. It goes away when the caps lift after the audit.</li>
                <li>Testnet software. Mainnet comes in stages, privately first.</li>
