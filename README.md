# Cloak v2: private launches and private trading for Elysium, on Gloam

**Site: [oncloak.xyz](https://oncloak.xyz)** (mainnet, keeper at keeper.oncloak.xyz) and [testnet.oncloak.xyz](https://testnet.oncloak.xyz) (testnet), being hosted. Cloak v1 stays at [cloak.boblabs.tech](https://cloak.boblabs.tech) and lives in its own repository.

> **Launches nobody can snipe, and trades nobody can trace.** Bids stay sealed until bidding closes, hidden even from the sequencer. Every winner pays **one clearing price**, and the launch opens a Uniswap v4 pool at that price. After launch, anyone can hold, send, buy and sell the token **from a private balance** kept in [Gloam](https://github.com/gloamtrade/gloam)'s shielded vault: proofs are made on your device and a relay sends them, so your wallet never appears.

Plain-English walkthrough: [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md). Handover for whoever works on this next: [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md). Things to check after hosting: [CHECK.md](CHECK.md).

## What v2 is

Cloak v1 had its own vaults, circuits and verifiers. **v2 keeps none of them.** Every proof is a Gloam proof on Gloam's final ceremony keys, checked by Gloam's verifiers, which we never change. There are three vaults, and each asset has exactly one home:
- **Gloam's main vault** (run by Gloam): HYPE, USDC and the tokens Gloam lists, such as KNTQ.
- **`CloakLaunchVault`** (Cloak's own): Cloak launch tokens. It's Gloam's vault code, plus `admitLaunch` for a settled Cloak launch.
- **`CloakEcosystemVault`** (Cloak's own): other projects' tokens Cloak lists, either from a launchpad whose code Cloak vetted or vetted on their own. The listing rules are fixed: a real pool, minimum liquidity and market cap, and caps relative to supply.

Around the vaults sit small escrows that turn a Gloam proof into an action:

| Contract | What it does |
|---|---|
| **CloakFactory** + **CloakV4Hook** | Sealed-bid launches. Each settled launch opens a Uniswap v4 pool at its clearing price. The hook keeps the liquidity forever, and splits trading fees 80% to the creator, 20% to Cloak |
| **CloakRouterV4** | Private swaps between the three vaults, up to three pools (USDC to a launch token through HYPE). It takes Cloak's 0.25% trade fee in HYPE or USDC on sales out of Cloak's vaults (**CloakTradeFee**) |
| **CloakGloamBatcherV4** | Batch rounds in standard sizes, so a trade's size is hidden too |
| **CloakGloamBids** | Sealed bids paid from a private balance |
| **CloakGloamReceive** | Receive addresses anyone can pay, shielded by the owner's app, and the landing spot for bridging in through Relay |
| **CloakFundsGate**, **CloakReceiptCheck** | Allocation gates and receipts, proved with Gloam's own holder circuit |
| **CloakWHYPE** | The routers' own fixed WHYPE (Elysium's is upgradeable) |

## Mainnet (Elysium, chain `99901`): coming, in stages

The whole deploy has been rehearsed against Gloam's real Elysium vault (`0x89d3…2164`) on a fork of mainnet, with real proofs and real pools (`e2e-gloam/part22-mainnet-fork.mjs`). Here's what's settled:
- **Fees:**
  - 1.5% of a successful raise;
  - 20% of launch pools' trading fees;
  - 0.25% on private sales out of Cloak's vaults;
  - Gloam's own 0.5% when value leaves their vault, half of it shared with Cloak.
  - The relay is free for users.
- **Caps:** Gloam's vault starts small (12 HYPE and 500 USDC per deposit), and the caps rise with Gloam. The app splits bigger deposits, trades and bids to fit.
- **Keys:** one owner wallet and a separate treasury, with a multisig later.

The rest:
- the plan step by step: [`docs/MAINNET-CHECKLIST.md`](docs/MAINNET-CHECKLIST.md);
- every decision and why: [`docs/MAINNET-DECISIONS.md`](docs/MAINNET-DECISIONS.md);
- the token: [`docs/CLOAK.md`](docs/CLOAK.md).

## Live on Elysium testnet (chain `99801`)

v2 has **its own launch factory** (Nov 9), apart from Cloak v1's. Its rules are copied from v1's: launch fee 1.5%, auctions capped at 100 HYPE per bid and 10,000 HYPE in total. The launch vault and every escrow were redeployed on it, and the first launch, **GLOAK**, is admitted and registered for batch rounds.

The full record: [`deployments/elysium-testnet-gloam.json`](deployments/elysium-testnet-gloam.json) and [`deployments/elysium-testnet-v2-factory.json`](deployments/elysium-testnet-v2-factory.json). The SDK carries the same addresses (`deploymentFor(99801)`). Every rule, with its number: [`docs/RULES.md`](docs/RULES.md). On testnet, HYPE and launch tokens share the launch vault. Mainnet uses the three-vault model above.

## Layout

```
contracts/          Foundry: the launch side (CloakConfig, CloakFactory, CloakAuction, CloakToken, CloakVesting, drops)
contracts-gloam/    Cloak's contracts around Gloam's vault: the launch and ecosystem vaults, the router, the trade fee and the escrows
contracts-v4/       The v4 side: CloakV4Hook, CloakLaunchSwapV4, CloakGloamBatcherV4, tested on the real PoolManager
vendor/gloam/       Gloam's repository, pinned. Never edited
packages/sdk/       @cloakely/sdk: launches (Cloak) and private balances (GloamPrivate)
packages/mcp/       @cloakely/mcp: an MCP server so agents can launch, bid and trade privately
services/keeper/    Reveals and settles launches, relays private actions (POST /gloam/relay), runs batch rounds,
                    holds split withdrawals (POST /schedule) and serves the vaults' leaf lists (GET /leaves)
apps/web/           The site (Vite + React), on Vercel
e2e-gloam/          End-to-end runs: anvil, forks of testnet and live
```

## For launchpads: `@cloakely/sdk`

```ts
import { Cloak, GloamPrivate, deploymentFor, gloamProvers, gloamRelaySubmitter } from "@cloakely/sdk";
const d = deploymentFor(99801);
const cloak = new Cloak(publicClient, walletClient, d.factory);

await cloak.createLaunch({ name: "Shade", symbol: "SHADE", /* sale, ticks, windows */ });
await cloak.bid(auction, { maxPrice, quantity }); // a hash and a drand ciphertext on chain, nothing else

const g = d.gloam;
const priv = await GloamPrivate.unlock(walletClient, {
  publicClient, chainId: 99801, payMemo: g.memoBoard, whype: g.whype,
  gloamVault: { pool: g.gloamVault, poolBlock: g.block },
  launchVault: { pool: g.launchVault, poolBlock: g.launchVaultBlock ?? g.block },
  launchSwapV4: g.launchSwapV4, batcherV4: g.batcherV4, receive: g.receive, bids: g.bids,
  provers: gloamProvers(), submit: gloamRelaySubmitter(KEEPER_URL),
});
await priv.shieldHype(walletClient, parseEther("1")); // the one public step
await priv.buy(token, parseEther("0.25"));            // the relay sends it, your wallet never shows
await priv.batch(token, "buy", parseEther("0.37"));   // size hidden too
```

## Run it

Prerequisites: Node 22, pnpm, Foundry. In a container, Node's `fetch` needs `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`.

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
pnpm test                       # forge (contracts, contracts-gloam, contracts-v4) and the SDK tests
node e2e-gloam/part7-adapter.mjs  # the site's backend end to end on anvil, real proofs
```

The full list of end-to-end runs is in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) and [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md).

### Hosting

| Part | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Site | Vercel, root `apps/web` | Env `VITE_CHAIN_ID` (99801 or 99901), `VITE_RPC_URL`, `VITE_RPC_BACKUP` (backup RPCs, failover), `VITE_KEEPER_URL` and `VITE_RELAYER_URL`. Addresses come from the SDK, never from env |
| Keeper | Render free plan, [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) | `KEEPER_PK` and `RPC_BACKUP` in Render's dashboard. Sleeps when idle and wakes on the site's first request. See [docs/OPTIMIZATION.md](docs/OPTIMIZATION.md) |

## Honest limits

- **Hidden:** who traded, what each account holds, which trades belong together, and in batch mode each trader's size. Private sends hide the amount.
- **Visible:** an instant trade's size and direction on the public pool, a batch round's net, and the amounts of deposits and withdrawals.
- **Batch privacy needs company.** Alone in a round, your orders add up to your trade.
- **Timing can link you.** Shielding 1 HYPE and buying with exactly 1 HYPE right after is easy to connect.
- **The relay** can refuse or delay a call and sees your IP. It can't change anything: the proof binds every field. Anyone can run one.
- **Sealed bids** rely on the drand network. A threshold of its members colluding could open bids early.
- **Vault caps.** Gloam's vault caps each deposit for now. Bigger amounts go in parts, and a full vault total stops new deposits until the cap rises.
- **Not audited yet.** Cloak's own contracts are reviewed internally, and an outside audit comes next. Until then, caps stay on. Gloam's vault itself was audited by Kann.
